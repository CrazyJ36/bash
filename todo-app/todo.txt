# This should be able to list, list, add and remove todos like:
# 1. 1st todo
# 2. 2nd todo
# then manipulate line numbers.

# Using Bash:
# you can start A list by using the followimg command. 
# This prints 'thing-to-do' to a new file 'todo.txt'. 
echo thing-to-do > todo.txt

# Using '>' again will reset the file. To add(append) things:
echo thing-to-do >> todo.txt
